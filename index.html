				<p>I have always had a passion for all things technology, whether it be new hardware, software, video games, or emerging technologies. I studied computer science at UNC Charlotte for a short time before transferring to a Computer Information Technology focus and I currently hold an AAS from Guilford Technology Community College. I started my career in IT while studying at GTCC and after graduating I went on to get my CompTIA A+ certification. After almost 5 years as a Systems/Network Administrator in the Startup and Corporate IT world - I realized that software development may better suit my skills and enthusiasm for technology. Today I am working towards pivoting my career into development. I am very excited to say that I enrolled in the development bootcamp Coder Foundry and I will be attending the summer course starting on July 11th at the Charlotte, NC location! Coder Foundry will help me hone the skills that I need to jump into the software development space and hit the ground running. This site is intended to be a portfolio that portrays my projects that I have worked on thus far.
